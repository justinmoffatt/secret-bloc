### About
A re-skin of the card based game "Secret Hitler" but the fascist party is the Bloc Québécois. This will be a single system game meant for a tablet or phone type device, where it can be passed around to each player. 

### Technical About
This project is going to start out as a pygame project because I like how simple python is, and I didn't want to dive into lua again for the use of LOVE2D. Depending if I read the webpage I found on data-oriented design for programming, I might change this to a data oriented project in some other language. Until then, python 3 with pygame it is.
