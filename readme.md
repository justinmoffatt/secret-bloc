### About
A re-skin of the card based game "Secret Hitler" but the fascist party is the Bloc Québécois. This will be a single system game meant for a tablet or phone type device, where it can be passed around to each player. 

### Technical About
This project is going to start out as a LÖVE2D project in Lua. Depending if I read the webpage I found on data-oriented design for programming, I might change this to a data oriented project in some other language. Until then, LÖVE2D is easy and I know how to export it as an apk for Android mobile.
